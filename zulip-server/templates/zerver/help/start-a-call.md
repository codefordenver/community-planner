## Change your video chat provider

By default, Zulip integrates with
[Jitsi Meet](https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/), a fully-encrypted, 100% open
source video conferencing solution. Organization administrators can also
change the organization's video chat provider.

Note that the Google Hangouts integration requires a paid Google G
Suite account.

### Change your organization's video chat provider
